# Gutenberg Snippets

VSCode snippets for [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) development. This project was heavily inspired by [https://github.com/ItsJonQ/wordpress-components-snippets] and steals the same approach to managing and building the snippets.


## Development
1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. DO WORK!
3. Generate the updated snippets: `npm run generate`

The snippets are stored in the snippet-data directory in a subdirectory that corresponds to the snippet's category. For example, the components that are part of the `@wordpress/components` package are stored in the `components` directory, PHP related snippets are stored in the `php` directory and so on.

To add a new snippet category, simply add a new directory to the snippet-data directory and update the package.json file to include the new category to the `contributes.snippets` array.

To add a new snippet to any category, create a new file called {snippet}.snip. Please use a name that makes it clear what the snippet represents. For example, a snippet for the `<Button />` component would be named `button.snip`.

Once the file has been created, there is a custom snippet for the workspace that will automatically add the snippet to the snippet file. Trigger it by typing `snip` in the new file. Please use this scaffold as a starting point to keep the format consistent.

The .snip files use front-matter to store the data about the snippet

Raw snippet file:
```plaintext
---
title: Alignment Matrix Control
prefix: wp.components|AlignmentMatrixControl
description: AlignmentMatrixControl components enable adjustments to horizontal and vertical alignments for UI.
---

$LINE_COMMENT Reference: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components/src/alignment-matrix-control",

import { AlignmentMatrixControl } from '@wordpress/components';

<AlignmentMatrixControl value={ alignment } onChange={ setAlignment } />
```

Converts to in snippet file:
```json
"Alignment Matrix Control": {
    "prefix": [
      "wp.components",
      "AlignmentMatrixControl"
    ],
    "description": "AlignmentMatrixControl components enable adjustments to horizontal and vertical alignments for UI.",
    "body": [
      "$LINE_COMMENT Reference: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components/src/alignment-matrix-control\",",
      "",
      "import { AlignmentMatrixControl } from '@wordpress/components';",
      "",
      "<AlignmentMatrixControl value={ alignment } onChange={ setAlignment } />"
    ]
},
```
Note that the prefix is pipe-delimited and is converted to an array in the json.


Inserted Snippet:
```jsx
// Reference: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components/src/alignment-matrix-control",

import { AlignmentMatrixControl } from '@wordpress/components';

<AlignmentMatrixControl value={ alignment } onChange={ setAlignment } />
```
